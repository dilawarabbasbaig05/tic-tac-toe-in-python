Game Overview

- Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns marking a square on the grid with their symbol (either X or O).
- The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.

Gameplay Rules

1. The game starts with an empty grid.
2. Player X makes the first move, placing their symbol (X) in one of the nine squares.
3. Player O makes their move by placing their symbol (O) in an empty square.
4. Players alternate turns.
5. A player cannot place their symbol in a square already occupied by their own symbol or their opponent's symbol.
6. A player wins when they have three of their symbols in a row, either:
    - Horizontally (across a row)
    - Vertically (up or down a column)
    - Diagonally (from top-left to bottom-right or top-right to bottom-left)
7. If a player has won, the game ends and they are declared the winner.
8. If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.

Additional Rules

- A player can only make one move per turn.
- A player cannot change their move once it has been made.
- If a player tries to make an invalid move (e.g., placing a symbol in an occupied square), their turn is skipped and their opponent's turn begins.
